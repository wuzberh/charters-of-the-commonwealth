# Article I: Separation of Powers

## Section 1. Legislative Power

The legislative power of the Digital Commonwealth shall be vested in a representative Assembly, elected by the people at regular intervals. The Assembly shall have sole authority to enact statutes, raise revenue, declare war, and make all other laws necessary and proper for the execution of the powers herein granted. No law shall take effect unless it has been passed by a majority of the Assembly and published in the public repository of the Commonwealth.

## Section 2. Executive Power

The executive power shall be vested in a Council of Ministers, appointed by the Assembly and subject to its confidence. The Council shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws, the administration of public services, the conduct of foreign relations, and the command of the Commonwealth's defensive forces. The Council may issue regulations consistent with statutory law, but no regulation shall contravene an act of the Assembly.

## Section 3. Judicial Power

The judicial power shall be vested in independent Courts, established by law. The Courts shall have authority to interpret the statutes and this Charter, to adjudicate disputes arising under them, and to review the constitutionality of governmental acts. Judges shall hold their offices during good behavior and shall not be subject to removal by the executive or legislative branches except through impeachment for proven misconduct.

## Section 4. Checks and Balances

No person shall simultaneously hold office in more than one branch of government. Each branch shall be prohibited from exercising the core functions of the others, except where expressly permitted by this Charter. The Assembly may impeach and remove members of the Council or judges for cause; the Council may veto legislation, subject to an override by a two‑thirds vote of the Assembly; the Courts may declare laws or executive actions void if they violate this Charter.

## Section 5. Supremacy of the Charter

This Article, and the Charter as a whole, shall be the supreme law of the Digital Commonwealth. Any act of government contrary to its provisions shall be null and void. The separation of powers herein established is inviolable and may not be abolished or substantially altered except by a constitutional amendment ratified by three‑fourths of the Assembly and confirmed by a popular referendum.

# The Digital Commonwealth Charter

## Preamble

In the course of human events, it becomes necessary for people to establish new forms of governance that reflect the principles of liberty, reason, and self‑determination. We, the founders of the Digital Commonwealth, hereby declare our commitment to create a society where power derives from the consent of the governed, where the rights of individuals are inviolable, and where the common good is advanced through open deliberation and transparent law.

Inspired by the spirit of Thomas Paine's "Common Sense," we recognize that government is at best a necessary institution, and that its only legitimate purpose is to secure the natural rights of its citizens. The Digital Commonwealth therefore rejects any form of arbitrary or unaccountable authority. We affirm that every member of this society possesses an equal right to participate in the making of the laws that bind them, and that no edict shall be enacted without the clear and deliberative assent of the people.

Our Commonwealth is founded upon the conviction that technology can serve as a tool for liberation, enabling a more direct, inclusive, and responsive democracy. We pledge to use the tools of version control, open collaboration, and public review to ensure that our charter remains a living document, subject to continuous improvement by those it governs. Let this repository stand as the first enduring record of our collective will—a testament to the possibility of building a just and free society in the digital age.
